# 2513 Finals -- Coding Challenge

This repository contains the official **2513 Finals Practical Exam** for
strengthening students' logical and algorithmic skills using
**JavaScript**.\
Each challenge focuses on core programming fundamentals that every
student must master before advancing to more complex software
development topics.

## 🚀 What's Inside

### ✔ 15 Coding Problems

Files are organized as:

    problems/
      problem1.js
      problem2.js
      ...
      problem15.js

Each file contains:

-   A problem description\
-   A function template\
-   Test cases in comments\
-   Export statements for the test runner

### ✔ Sample Template

`_sample.js` demonstrates the formatting and structure expected in each
solution.

### ✔ Automated Test Runner

`test.js` allows students to:

-   Test a single problem\
-   Or run all problems automatically\
-   See pass/fail results in the console

To run:

``` bash
node test.js
```

## 🛠 How to Use

1.  Clone the repository

    ``` bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/2513-finals-coding-challenge.git
    ```

2.  Install dependencies (if any)

    ``` bash
    npm install
    ```

3.  Solve each problem inside `/problems`.\

4.  Run the automated tests

    ``` bash
    node test.js
    ```

## 🎯 Purpose of This Challenge

This practical exam is designed to:

-   Sharpen logical reasoning\
-   Strengthen core JavaScript fundamentals\
-   Practice clean and modular coding\
-   Prepare students for real-world problem-solving

Students must demonstrate mastery of:

-   Loops\
-   Conditionals\
-   Functions\
-   Arrays\
-   Basic algorithms\
-   Modular JavaScript (imports/exports)

## 📚 Skills Reinforced

-   Algorithmic thinking\
-   Debugging procedures\
-   Writing clean, readable code\
-   Understanding input → process → output\
-   Breaking down complex problems into small steps

## 👨‍🏫 For Instructors

The test runner can instantly verify correctness, making grading fast
and objective.\
Problems are purposely arranged from **easy → moderate → challenging**,
promoting growth in logical skills.
