## 🚀 What's Inside

### ✔ 15 Coding Problems

Files are organized as:

```
problems/
  problem1.js
  problem2.js
  ...
  problem15.js
```

Each file includes:

-   Problem description
-   Function template
-   Test cases in comments
-   Export statement for the test runner

### ✔ Sample Template

`_sample.js` demonstrates the proper formatting and structure expected in each solution.

### ✔ Automated Test Runner

`test.js` allows students to:

-   Test a single problem
-   Run all problems automatically
-   View pass/fail results in the console

Run tests with:

```bash
node test.js
```
